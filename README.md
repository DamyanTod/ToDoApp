# Architecture Viper
templates: https://github.com/evori/viper

I used this architecture, because is easy to extend functionalities.
For example: 
  * if we want ot add multiple storyboards, easy can be done in the router.
  * if we want to add API we can do it in the interactor
  * if we want to create at the begining or in later state Unit testing we can do it easyly with all protocols which are available from the architecture.
